# Vocabulary

*activecode*<br />
    A unique interpreter environment that allows Python to be executed from within a web browser.<br /><br />
*algorithm*<br />
    A general step by step process for solving a problem.<br /><br />
*bug*<br />
    An error in a program.<br /><br />
*byte code*<br />
    An intermediate language between source code and object code. Many modern languages first compile source code into byte code and then interpret the byte code with a program called a virtual machine.<br /><br />
*codelens*<br />
    An interactive environment that allows the user to control the step by step execution of a Python program.<br /><br />
*comment*<br />
    Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program.<br /><br />
*compile*<br />
    To translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.<br /><br />
*debugging*<br />
    The process of finding and removing any of the three kinds of programming errors.<br /><br />
*exception*<br />
    Another name for a runtime error.<br /><br />
*executable*<br />
    Another name for object code that is ready to be executed.<br /><br />
*formal language*<br />
    Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.<br /><br />
*high-level language*<br />
    A programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write.<br /><br />
*interpret*<br />
    To execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time.<br /><br />
*low-level language*<br />
    A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called machine language or assembly language.<br /><br />
*natural language*<br />
    Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.<br /><br />
*object code*<br />
    The output of the compiler after it translates the program.<br /><br />
*parse*<br />
    To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.<br /><br />
*portability*<br />
    A property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer.<br /><br />
*print function*<br />
    A function used in a program or script that causes the Python interpreter to display a value on its output device.<br /><br />
*problem solving*<br />
    The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing the solution.<br /><br />
*program*<br />
    A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and computations to be performed.<br /><br />
*programming language*<br />
    A formal notation for representing solutions.<br /><br />
*Python shell*<br />
    An interactive user interface to the Python interpreter. The user of a Python shell types commands at the prompt (>>>), and presses the return key to send these commands immediately to the interpreter for processing.<br /><br />
runtime error
    An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing.<br /><br />
*semantic error*<br />
    An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.<br /><br />
*semantics*<br />
    The meaning of a program.<br /><br />
*shell mode*<br />
    A style of using Python where we type expressions at the command prompt, and the results are shown immediately. Contrast with source code, and see the entry under Python shell.<br /><br />
*source code*<br />
    A program, stored in a file, in a high-level language before being compiled or interpreted.<br /><br />
*syntax*<br />
    The structure of a program.<br /><br />
*syntax error*<br />
    An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse â€” and therefore impossible to interpret.<br /><br />
*token*<br />
    One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a natural language. <br /><br />
